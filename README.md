# GildedRose-Refactoring KATA

This is a refactoring kata based on the GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata.

I will not remove my branches, so you can see how I did the kata. In particular, the refactor/clean_codebase branch that solves the kata by implementing polymorphism.
I preferred the annotation solution, because it is more readable and easier to understand.
Moreover, it is closer than a "real" scalable solution, where the rules would be provided by a config or a database.

## How to run the application

`./gradlew run`

## How to run the tests

`./gradlew cucumber`
